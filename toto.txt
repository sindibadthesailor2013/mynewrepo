I'm playing with Git in isolation on my own machine, 
and I find it difficult to maintain a mental model of all 
my branches and commits. I know I can do a git log to see 
the commit history from where I am, but is there a way to
 see the entire branch topography, something like these ASCII 
 maps that seem to be used everywhere for explaining branches?
